    description: "The first-generation Chevrolet Spark sold globally (known as the Daewoo Matiz in some markets) was a city-focused minicar featuring a tall, narrow body design that maximized interior space despite its tiny footprint. In North America, it arrived for the 2013 model year powered by a 1.2L four-cylinder engine producing just 84 HP, paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Despite its modest power, the lightweight design provided adequate urban performance with excellent fuel economy. The interior was surprisingly spacious for its size class and featured motorcycle-inspired gauges and available technology including a touchscreen infotainment system. Bold color options and quirky styling helped distinguish it in the minicar segment. The Spark represented Chevrolet's entry into the smallest vehicle segment in North America, targeting urban dwellers seeking easy parking and maneuverability."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Spark featured more mature styling with less exaggerated proportions while maintaining the small footprint that defined the model. The overall height was reduced by about 1.6 inches while the width increased slightly, giving it a more grounded appearance. Power came from a 1.4L four-cylinder engine producing 98 HP, paired with a five-speed manual or continuously variable transmission (CVT). The interior featured improved materials and significantly updated technology, including a standard 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility on most trims. Advanced safety features became available, including forward collision alert and lane departure warningâ€”unusual for the minicar segment. A brief all-electric Spark EV variant was offered in limited markets from 2013-2016, featuring a 130 HP electric motor and approximately 82 miles of range. The second-generation Spark maintained its position as the smallest Chevrolet while offering surprising technology and safety features for its class. Production ended in 2022 without a direct replacement, as consumer preferences shifted toward larger vehicles and GM reduced its small car offerings in North America."
